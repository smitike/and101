## Summary

**Profile Card** is an Android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø.  **The app displays a profile picture, name, a short bio, and three hobbies that simply introduce the person.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòÄ üñêüèΩ ü§ì**

## Notes

The app is created on Android Studio using Kotlin. I learned how to create the UI on Android Studio while editing the layout which seemed straightforward to edit. However, I had trouble changing the color because I couldn't find different colors and I thought Android Studio had limited colors. Then, I started looking through the other files and I found themes.xml where all the colors added were. Unlike other platforms, I found out that we need to add colors we want to use.
